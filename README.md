Usage:
  Run the script.
  Move the mouse during the 10-second capture period.
  The script will create an entropy.txt file containing mouse movement interval and use said txt file to generate your password
  You can change the length of the password by changing the num_samples variable.

Notes:
  Code is not clean. It started as just an entropy generator using the mouse and keyboard intervals.
  I couldn't care less to also use the keyboard interval so I left them there.
